CORBETT'S ELECTROSTATIC MACHINE,,Canterbury,Thomas Corbett,Machine,
CIRCULAR SAW,1813,Harvard,Tabitha Babbitt,Machine,"The spinning wheel was an early machine used to transform natural fibers into spinning thread or yarn. It was composed of a drive wheel, table, treadle and legs as well as parts that held the fibers. A weaver by trade, Babbitt noticed that the drive wheel spun in a continual circular motion and didn’t need to be continually reset like the inefficient pit saw. By carving a circular saw blade and attaching it to her spinning wheel, every movement of the disk made a cut."

IRONING STOVE,1793,Watervliet,,Tool,
BANDAGE ROLLER,,Mount Lebanon,Isaac Newton Young,Tool,"The wooden wheels mounted on the winding shaft are adjustable. By turning a small thumbscrew the distance between the wheels can be set from zero to two inches. While this adjustment is appropriate as bandaging materials could certainly vary in width, it makes one think that it would also be an appropriate tool for winding all kinds of narrow materials – bonnet edging, carpet binding, strapping, and even short pieces of chair webbing"

MAIL ORDER SEED PACKET,1794,Mount Lebanon,,Product Line,
TILTING CHAIR,1852,,,Product Line,The Shakers may have initially developed button joint tilts as a feature to make their chairs more saleable to the world.
FLAT BROOM VICE,1798,Watervliet,,Production Technique,"The vise consists of two upright planks, one rigidly fixed to the base and the other hinged via a pair of short distance pieces. This can be clearly seen in the small vise on the left of the illustration ""Making Shaker brooms"". The handle of the broom can pass between the distance pieces, the length of the handle imposing a minimum size on the fixed upright. Larger vises may have the movable jaw hinged at the base and do away with the distance pieces"
